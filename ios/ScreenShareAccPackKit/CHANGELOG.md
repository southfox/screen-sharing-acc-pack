--------------------------------------

2.0.0
-----

### Enhancements
- Remove shared instance so developers can control it.

1.1.6
-----

### Enhancements

- Introduce `isRemoteAudioAvailable` and `isRemoteVideoAvailable` to have more audio and video control.

1.1.5
-----

### Enhancements

- Nil out `publisherView` and `subscriberView` in `disconnect` method for avoiding potential side effect.

1.1.4
-----

### Enhancements

- Add `subscriberVideoContentMode` for displaying a fit or fill video.
- Add `subscribeToStreamWithName:` for switching to another stream.
- Add `subscribeToStreamWithStreamId:` for switching to another stream.
- Make sure that the publisher has a name.
- Nil out `publisher` and `subscriber` in `disconnect` method for avoiding potential side effect.

1.1.3
-----

### Enhancements

- Enhance documentation

1.1.2
-----
